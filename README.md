## üß± Architecture Overview

This project uses a pragmatic **Feature‚ÄëFirst** layout:

```
lib/
 ‚îú‚îÄ main.dart                # App entrypoint / root MaterialApp
 ‚îú‚îÄ config/                  # (Future) global configs, themes, constants
 ‚îú‚îÄ core/                    # (Future) shared utilities, services, models
 ‚îî‚îÄ features/                # Each domain feature is self-contained
	 ‚îú‚îÄ splash/              # Splash screen UI
	 ‚îú‚îÄ auth/                # Login screen(s)
	 ‚îú‚îÄ home/                # Home feed & widgets
	 ‚îú‚îÄ category/            # Category listing components
	 ‚îú‚îÄ cart/                # Cart screen (logic-ready)
	 ‚îú‚îÄ print/               # Print / receipt style preview
	 ‚îî‚îÄ nevigation/          # Bottom navigation shell
		 ‚îú‚îÄ bottomnavscreen.dart
```

Guiding Principles:

-   Isolation: Each feature owns its screens + widgets.
-   Clarity over cleverness: Minimal abstractions until needed.
-   Progressive enhancement: `config/` & `core/` are placeholders for scaling (theme, API clients, DI, repos, etc.).
-   Asset-driven UI: Images kept under `assets/images/` & registered in `pubspec.yaml`.

## üìÇ Detailed Folder Structure

```

 ‚îú‚îÄ fonts/                   # Poppins font family
 ‚îî‚îÄ screenshots/             # Static showcase screenshots used in README

 ‚îú‚îÄ features/
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ splash/              # Splash screen widget(s)
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ auth/                # Login UI (future expansion: OTP, session)
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ home/                # Home screen + sales widget cards
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ category/            # Category browsing UI & list widget

 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ print/               # Print-style invoice / preview screen
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ nevigation/          # Bottom navigation controller
 ‚îú‚îÄ config/                  # (Scalable placeholder)
 ‚îî‚îÄ core/                    # (Scalable placeholder)
test/                        # Basic Flutter widget test
```

## üß™ Testing

Basic starter test exists under `test/widget_test.dart` (generated). Future enhancements could add:

-   Golden tests for UI consistency
-   Unit tests for pricing & cart logic
-   Integration tests for navigation flows

Run all tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

-   [ ] Dark theme + theming system in `config/`
-   [ ] Router migration (GoRouter) with deep links
-   [ ] Localization (intl) & RTL support
-   [ ] Analytics + crash reporting integration
-   [ ] CI workflow (GitHub Actions) for tests & format
-   [ ] Release build badges & store deployment script

## üß© Extending This Project

1. Add a `core/services/` folder for API, storage, logging.
2. Introduce a `models/` folder inside each feature or a shared `core/models/`.
3. Extract theme + color palette into `config/theme.dart`.
4. Add dependency injection (e.g., `get_it`) when services appear.
5. Migrate navigation to declarative router for maintainability.
